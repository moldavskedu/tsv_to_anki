# tsv_to_anki
Simple .tsv to .apkg converter

if you experience errors make sure python and all necessary libraries are installed. (genanki, tkinter, logging)

this program has very basic logging (should export logs as app.txt) 
very basic error handling 

Im about 8 months in learning python and have a lot left to learn so any tweaks, advice, and general help is very appreciated.
